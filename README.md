# Hi there.
I'm Jait. This is my home on the web.

Most of the things on this website are either about things I did at Uni or tech that caught my attention or the combination of the two. There's gonna be a lot of 'output' copy pasted directly from the terminal along with screengrabs of things I play with.

My day job is as a junior consultant at KJR, Melbourne. I spend most of the time there working with clients and professional development on embracing good software testing practices. 

Thanks for taking the time to visit my page.
